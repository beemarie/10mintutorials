# 10mintutorials

This repo contains a set of 10 minute tutorials for IBM Cloud Code Engine. 

Containers
In the containers tutorial you will create an IBM Cloud Object Storage instance and an IBM Cloud Code Engine Application. The application will accept URLs of images, download the image, and then store the image in your COS instance.

Jobs
In the jobs tutorial, you will create a job that creates thumbnails out of any images stored in your IBM Cloud Object Storage instance. You will also learn about Service Bindings by binding your COS instance to your job. Service bindings provide applications and jobs access to IBM Cloud services.
