This repo contains a set of 10 minute tutorials for IBM Cloud Code Engine. 

## Containers - Hello World
In the hello world [containers tutorial](hello-containers/README.md) you will create a hello world application on IBM Cloud Code Engine. The application will respond to get requests with hello world.

## Src2Image - Hello World
In the [source to image tutorial](hello-source-image/README.md), you will deploy the same application as was deployed in the containers hello world tutorial, but this time you will be deploying from the source code, as opposed to deploying from a pre-built container image.

## Jobs - Hello World
In the [job tutorial](hello-job/README.md), you will deploy a simple job with IBM Cloud Code Engine. The job will run to completion, and you will be able to view details about it.

## Containers - COS
In the [containers tutorial](container/README.md) you will create an IBM Cloud Object Storage instance and an IBM Cloud Code Engine Application. The application will accept URLs of images, download the image, and then store the image in your COS instance.

## Jobs & Service Bindings - COS
In the jobs tutorial, you will create a job that creates thumbnails out of any images stored in your IBM Cloud Object Storage bucket. You will also learn about Service Bindings by binding your COS instance to your job. Service bindings provide applications and jobs access to IBM Cloud services.
