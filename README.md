# 10mintutorials

:construction: This repo is under active development. :construction:

This repo contains a set of 10 minute tutorials for IBM Cloud Code Engine. 

## Containers
In the [containers tutorial](container/README.md) you will create an IBM Cloud Object Storage instance and an IBM Cloud Code Engine Application. The application will accept URLs of images, download the image, and then store the image in your COS instance.

## Jobs & Service Bindings
In the jobs tutorial, you will create a job that creates thumbnails out of any images stored in your IBM Cloud Object Storage bucket. You will also learn about Service Bindings by binding your COS instance to your job. Service bindings provide applications and jobs access to IBM Cloud services.


## Src2Image
In the source to image tutorial, you will deploy the same application as was deployed in the container tutorial, but this time you will be deploying from the source code, as opposed to deploying from a pre-built container image.

## Events
TBD
